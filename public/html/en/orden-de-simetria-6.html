	<h2><strong>Simmetry Dynamics</strong></h2>
    <p>The manifestation Phases of the different  simmetries, are under no doubt, dynamic, meaning not static.</p>
    <p>It all depends on the individual&acute;s  interaction with its environment, regarding the different circumstances and  their corresponding influence.</p>
    <p>So much so, both the 2 Phases and their 4  Determinations, may vary from one circumstance to another.</p>
    <p>At times one may be in harmony,&nbsp; then undergo an excess or a shortage, facing  different situations or eventualities.</p>
    <p>Then the Stability Phase might imply  harmony, where the individual ought to be at its peak, depending on their own  singularities and individual talents.</p>
    <p>When an individual gets stuck in any of the  Instability Phase Determinations, he will then start losing integral harmony.&nbsp; This lack of harmony will distort his  perception of reality, as if&nbsp; watching  through a prism, thus originating a totally different way of feeling and  interacting in the world.</p>

    People responding to symmetry order 6:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
An individual of this symmetry order will tend to be closely in touch with his
<span class="textGreen">sensibility</span>(Necessary Condition towards the world) and alert to the world and to those people around him. Probably susceptible to changes going on in any of the fields in which they move around – at work, family or emotional-, for example: where they are bound to be appreciated and loved for their good <span class="textGreen">response</span> (Tendency) and for their capability to <span class="textGreen">change</span> their stands and decisions <span class="textGreen">adjusting</span> (Theme in the world) on behalf of their relation to others.</li>
		<li>
			Affectionate and attentive to others, these people may spend a long time pondering and in general are very keen on drawing conclusions about others and on moving ahead to future events.  If they set their minds to it, they may reach to be excellent political or financial analysts, welfare workers or art critics.</li>
		<li>
  Due to this ability to change along with the world around him, most of the times they are prepared for unstable situations, given the nature they make use of, they are able to keep afloat <span class="textGreen">transforming</span> reality (World Desideratum) even in the worse scenarios or most drastic movements.</li>
		<li>Nevertheless, deep in their hearts, they wish to be acknowledged for their individuality and personality trying to be <span class="textGreen">loved</span> for those <span class="textBlue">qualities that make them unique</span>.</li>
		<li>They will try to keep up their <span class="textBlue">identity stability</span> (Experience) resisting any external influence willing to change them. In fact their actions and works might be recognized because on them is their author´s brand, a permanent signature of their style.</li>
		<li>The <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> with which they interrealate with the world, must
      work on behalf of his mineral heart, asking him to assimilate all this into his <span class="textBlue">identity</span>. This may take place when putting in order the sensitive world by an inner calssification, where they will also want to leave their brand as a witness for their <span class="textGreem">sensitivity</span>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Due to this articulation: <strong class="textGreen">vegetal to the world</strong> and <span class="textBlue"><strong>mineral heart</strong></span><strong>:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>they will want <span class="textGreen">to be loved</span> for their <span class="textBlue">individuality</span> and <span class="textBlue">personality</span>, those qualities that make them unique and make them stand out from the rest.</li>
		<li>With this urge they will seek to <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> to circumstances from within their<span class="textBlue">structure</span>: meaning they will need all their <span class="textGreen">actions</span> (social activities, family, affections), to be perfectly ruled and structured.  They will set their actions in order with an inner classification <span class="textGreen">adjusting</span>to reality with their <span class="textBlue">personal brand</span>.</li>
		<li>This is how by means of the <span class="textGreen">dependent sensitivity</span> by which their lives are ruled, they will search for personal <span class="textBlue">consolidation</span>.</li>
		<li>That is why they will try to <span class="textGreen">transform</span> the world in order to attain <span class="textBlue">perfection</span> the primordial goal of their lives.</li>
		<li>That´s why this tendency for <span class="textGreen">response</span> and <span class="textGreen">instability</span> facing circumstances, makes their <span class="textBlue">identity stability</span> possible, when projecting to the world the Non Conscious Purpose of their <strong class="textRed">Animal Nature</strong>: to manifest the <span class="textRed">Versatility of Expansion</span>.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Instability Phase<br />
		(inharmonic)</h3>
<h4>
		Instability by Excess</h4>
  <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textGreen">Tendency</span>): <span class="textGreen">Altering the environment</span>.<br />
  Relation to himself (<span class="textBlue">Experience</span>): <span class="textBlue">Permanent and excessive control</span>.  </p>
<p>When a person responding to symmetry order 6 suffers an Instability Phase by <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>they will keep on <span class="textGreen">altering</span> different and  <span class="textGreen">instable actions</span> according to what´s going on around them.  He lives in a <span class="textGreen">variable</span> atmosphere where he can easily shift from one mood to another, enclosed in a flow of feelings and experiences that might play him more than a few mishaps.</li>
		<li>He will feel the need of exerting an <span class="textBlue">excessive control</span> over everything going on.  Possibly he will make a <span class="textBlue">great effort</span> to be in command of the situations he finds himself in, not with a conquering spirit and blindly looking for success but as someone wanting <span class="textBlue">to keep things</span> in such a state that he may know and anticipate.</li>
		<li>Rarely will he take action tending to take the lead of events he might even become a spectator longing to be the "know it all" person.  This is about a fruitless effort to keep everything under his wing, trying different possibilities and options to attain this.</li>
</ul>
	<h4>
		Instability by Shortage</h4>
	<p>Relation to the world (<span class="textGreen">Tendency</span>): <span class="textGreen">Subordination. Surrender.Vulnerability</span>.<br />
		Relation to himself (<span class="textBlue">Experience</span>): <span class="textBlue">Anxiety of devastation</span>.</p>
	<p>When a person responding to symmetry order 6 suffers an Instability
Phase by <strong>Shortage</strong>:</p>
	<p>Instability will manifest itself as it shows in an individual of a vegetal-mineral nature, in shortage:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lack of harmony by shortage, will take away any possibility of taking hold of a situation and will a affect his entire sensitivity. He may even present a <span class="textGreen">subordinate</span> condition to circumstances with an absolute and deep feeling of <span class="textGreen">surrender</span> leaving him completely <span class="textGreen">vulnerable</span> to others.</li>
		<li>It´s s sort of anxiety together with a profound feeling of rupture, a point of no return (<span class="textBlue">anxiety of devastation</span>) that overwhelms him, leaving him totally subordinate, defeated and prone to give it all up, feeling he can´t hold on anymore.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When a person responding to symmetry order 6 suffers an instability phase by shortage, this may become manifest:</p>
	<p>Inner Nature/restoration/rescue:</p>
	<p class="textRed">Confrontation. Win/Loose. Conquering Spirit/Change of strategies</p>
  <p>In this way, some of these individuals appeal to their <span class="textRed">animal</span>, nature, that had remained latent until then:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Facing an extreme situation and amidst this scenery, possibly his "<span class="textRed">animality</span>"resting in his inner nature will come to the rescue, making him undergo numerous, fast, unexpected actions but, at the same time inefficient, surprising everybody with an ability to quarrel, to fight back and an unique resistance.  Nevertheless this rescue mission, will rarely prove effective and the energy required to bring about this restoration is almost always never enough.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Synopsis</h3>
	<p>This  confirms the instability of these determinations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>people responding to symmetry order 6 facing an extreme situation: at first they will <span class="textGreen">alter the environment</span> appealing to <span class="textBlue">excessive control</span> of all the <span class="textBlue">varying emotions</span> they possess or <span class="textGreen">vulnerable</span> they will <span class="textGreen">subordinate</span> and <span class="textGreen">surrender</span>. Facing the new situation they find themselves in a condition where <span class="textBlue">anxiety of devastation</span>will prevail. When the situation turns extreme they usually try to <span class="textRed">confront reality</span> trying to <span class="textRed">conquer it</span> appealing to a <span class="textRed">permanent change of strategies</span> in a fruitless way.</li>
