	<h2><strong>Simmetry Dynamics</strong></h2>
    <p>The manifestation Phases of the different  simmetries, are under no doubt, dynamic, meaning not static.</p>
    <p>It all depends on the individual&acute;s  interaction with its environment, regarding the different circumstances and  their corresponding influence.</p>
    <p>So much so, both the 2 Phases and their 4  Determinations, may vary from one circumstance to another.</p>
    <p>At times one may be in harmony,&nbsp; then undergo an excess or a shortage, facing  different situations or eventualities.</p>
    <p>Then the Stability Phase might imply  harmony, where the individual ought to be at its peak, depending on their own  singularities and individual talents.</p>
    <p>When an individual gets stuck in any of the  Instability Phase Determinations, he will then start losing integral harmony.&nbsp; This lack of harmony will distort his  perception of reality, as if&nbsp; watching  through a prism, thus originating a totally different way of feeling and  interacting in the world.</p>

<h2>
		Symmetry Order 9 Dynamics</h2>
<p>As we may see in the following chart, in symmetry order 9,  relation to the world and relation to himself, are shared by the three realms, animal, vegetal
and mineral. Whoever may possess this symmetry might show a behaviour like
symmetries 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8; therefore it is the clinical study that will determine to which of these six symmetries he belongs to.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Are always active and are easily recognized because they never rest, that their <u>necessary condition</u> towards the world is <span class="textRed"><strong>movement</strong></span>.</li>
	</ul>
    <ul>
      <li>They are constantly working, surrounding themselves by newcomers who they dazzle with their knowledge, intelligence, their brand-new <span class="textBlue"><strong>projects</strong></span> and their wit.<br />
      They are tireless, are always seeking new goals and challenges to work with in every field, given that his main  <u>theme</u> is <span class="textRed"><strong>space</strong></span> and his <u>world desideratum in the world</u> is <span class="textRed"><strong>expansion</strong></span>.<br />
      Reluctant to follow others, more inclined to be the ones who guide the steps to follow.      </li>
      <li>Many people see them as role-models and they ususally transmit energy and inspire trust upon their subordinates or their family and their close circles, given their <u>tendency</u>:  <span class="textRed"><strong>coverage of the surroundings</strong></span>.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, their mineral heart will make them always seek for  <span class="textBlue"><strong>perfection</strong></span> and <span class="textBlue"><strong>stability</strong></span> (<u>necessary condition</u> and <u>individual desideratum</u>), they might turn out to be highly demanding with themselves and others, never giving up if they can prove themselves better with a new action. </li>
      <li>In harmony, the challenges they may actively pose to others, will be  in most cases successful as they will rely upon their own <strong>identity</strong><span class="textBlue"><strong></strong></span> traits (<u>Theme:</u> <span class="textBlue"><strong>consolidation</strong></span>) (<u>Experience</u>: <span class="textBlue"><strong>stability of their individuality</strong></span>)</li>
</ul>
    <p>Due to this articulation: <span class="textRed"><strong>animal towards the world </strong></span> and <span class="textBlue"><strong>mineral in the heart</strong></span><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>They will seek <span class="textRed">to be appreciated </span> for their <span class="textBlue">individuality</span> and <span class="textBlue">personality</span>, for those assets that make them unique and make them stand out from the rest. </li>
  <li>Guided by this urge, they will search for <span class="textRed">spaces</span> within a <span class="textBlue">structure</span>: meaning, they     will need that all the spaces they cover {social activities, family, affections have    to be perfectly ruled by a stable structure}  They will order their actions by an     inner classification thus  <span class="textRed">imprinting</span> reality with their <span class="textBlue">personal seal</span>.</li>
  <li>That is why all his  <span class="textRed">movements</span> will always aim at his personal  <span class="textBlue">consolidation</span>.</li>
  <li>That is also why they will always try  <span class="textRed">expansion</span> in the world  to reach  <span class="textBlue">perfection</span> as a primordial goal in their lives.</li>
  <li>Therefore this tendency of  <span class="textRed"></span>coverage of the surroundings implies the  <span class="textBlue">stability of    his identity </span> in projecting towards the world the Non Conscious Purpose of his <span class="textGreen"><strong>Vegetal Nature</strong></span>: manifestation of his <span class="textGreen">Sensitivity Transformation</span>.</li>

	<p>Relation to the world: <span class="textRed">Confrontation/Win/Loose/Conquest Spirit</span>.</p>
  <p>Relation to himself: <span class="textBlue">Permanent and Excessive Control.</span></p>
  <p>When a person responding to Symmetry Order 1 suffers an Instability Phase by  <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>his animal characteristics are reinforced and they may turn into  highly compettitive people (<span class="textRed"><strong>Confrontation/Win/Loose</strong></span>) searching for success at any cost (<span class="textRed"><strong>Conquest Spirit</strong></span>).</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, their mineral heart will lead them to always try and be in command of situations, imposing a <span class="textBlue"><strong>strong</strong></span> and<span class="textBlue"><strong> excessive control</strong></span>, almost opressive to themselves, to circumstances and to those around him.</li>
      <li>These intents will have poor results, in keeping under his wing, on a permanent basis,  whatever is going on, though he will try different options and possibilities to attain this, attempting to apply pressure and confronting with his control.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>
		Instability by Shortage</h4>
  <p>Relation to the world  (<span class="textRed"></span>Tendency): </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="textRed"> Submission/Capitulation/Hindrance.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Relation to himself  (<span class="textBlue">Experience</span>):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="textBlue">Anxiety by devastation</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a person responding to Symmetry Order 1 suffers an Instability Phase by<strong> Shortage</strong>:</p>
  <p>The Instability manifests itself by the apparition  of the animal-mineral nature of the individual in shortage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>feeling cornered and helpless, with no energy nor initiative  (<span class="textRed"><strong>hindrance</strong></span>). He  starts to develop a certain fear and therefore decides to adopt a complete state of <span class="textRed"><strong>submission</strong></span> towards others. Showing a complete  <span class="textRed"><strong>captulation</strong></span>.</li>
    <li>At his darkest hour, he will feel he&acute;s lost everything.  Internally, due to his mineral condition, a <span class="textBlue"><strong>state of anxiety</strong></span>, and <span class="textBlue"><strong>devastation</strong></span> will pervade and take hold of him completely, increasing the impossibility to regain leadership.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When a person responding to Symmetry Order 1 suffers an Instability Phase by <strong>Shortage, the following may manifest</strong>:</p>
  <p>Inner Nature/Restoration/Rescue: </p>
  <p class="textGreen"> Alteration of the environment/Circumstancial Adjustment/Justification </p>
  <p>Thus, some of these individuals appeal to their <span class="textGreen">vegetal</span>, nature, which had remained latent uptill now:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>facing an extreme situation, they adjust to new circumstances instead of trying to  change them and they keep on changing their needs and wishes according to  different difficulties that they may encounter, always inefficiently. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h3>
  <p>This makes evident the instability of these determinations: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>people responding to symmetry order 1, facing an extreme situation: at first, they will <span class="textRed">confront</span> and <span class="textBlue">control</span> to find a way to tackle the situation or they will submit and <span class="textRed">capitulate</span> in anxiety by devastation  and when the situation really gets extreme they usually <span class="textGreen">adjust circumstancially</span><span class="textGreen">, fruitlessly appealing to justification</span>.</li>

  <p>People responding to Symmetry Order 2:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are very  <span class="textGreen">affectionate</span> and <span class="textGreen">caring</span>, persons, who ususally are aware of everything going on around them, being that their  <u>necessary condition</u> towards the world is  <span class="textGreen">emotional dependance</span>. </li>
    <li>They are alert persons, remembering everything that we tell them, and may surprise us with their memory for details, for example: if they invite us for dinner at their place, they won´t forget our favorite dish, how much sugar we take with our coffee, the after-dinner chat, etc.</li>
    <li>They are always informed about what´s going on around them – in touch with all current news - also within their family and at work.</li>
    <li>These people  <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> (<u>Theme</u>)rapidly to changes and do not fear unstable conditions, being that they are verstile enough so as to always have the right and ready word or attitude.  In that way they may always hold an amiable chat with their boss or top manager in their firm, with the same candour and attention as with their most modest employee. </li>
    <li>Their ability to <span class="textGreen">respond</span> (<u>Tendency</u>) and for <span class="textGreen">transformation</span> (<u> World Desideratum</u>)facing other people´s actions and movements, is admirable, but rarely is he the promotor of a massive change, but mostly someone who tags along without outshining or being out of key.</li>
    <li>Given his <span class="rel_rojo">animal heart</span> the same verstility he shows for changes is put into action, thanks to his relentless <span class="textRed">creativity</span> (<u>Theme</u>), by which he manages to bring forth unique objects and pieces, his <span class="textRed">novelty</span> (<u>Experience</u>), often created and meant for a person in particular or for solving a specific situation.</li>
    <li>They are  excellent hosts and stand out in those activities in which they have to actively render service, like teaching in all its levels, any tourism branch like hotel-service and even trades such as fireman or rescue worker.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Due to this articulation: <span class="textGreen"><strong>vegetal</strong> <strong>towards the world</strong></span> and <span class="textRed"> <strong>animal</strong> <strong>heart</strong></span>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They desire <span class="textGreen">to be loved</span> for their <span class="textRed">acts</span>. These people deep in their heart, look for love and
 <span class="textGreen">affection</span> through the things they produce.</li>
    <li>To fulfil this yearning they <span class="textGreen">adjust</span>, yand due to their animal heart they tend to bring about numerous <span class="textRed">modifications</span> in their doings always under the inflluence of their emotions and their search for affection. This multiplies their interests and actions.</li>
    <li>That is why they need to <span class="textGreen">depend emotionally</span> on their environment for their <span class="textRed">creations</span>.</li>
    <li>That is why they will try to <span class="textGreen">transform</span> the world, in order to <span class="textRed">develop their versatility</span>, as primordial goal in their lives.</li>
    <li>So the meaning of this tendency for <span class="textGreen">response</span> and <span class="textGreen">instability</span>, is to find his <span class="textRed">novelty</span>, to project to the world the Non Conscious Purpose of his <strong class="textBlue">Mineral Nature</strong>: to manifest the <span class="textBlue">Perfection of Integrity</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
	  Instability Phase<br />
  (inharmonic)</h3>
  <h4>
		Instability by Excess</h4>
  <p>Relation to the world (Tendency): <span class="textGreen">Altering the environment</span>. </p>
  <p>Relation to himself (Experience): <span class="textRed">Altering the environment</span>. </p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>When a person responding to Symmetry Order 2 enters an Instability Phase by<strong>Excess</strong>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>He will enhance an unrestrained and unstable tendency  to adjust externally (vegetal characteristic) (<span class="textGreen">Altering the environment adjustment</span>). His mood transformed, he turns impredictable, without apparently noticing what´s going on around him. Beyond what happens to others, he will try to please, eagerly changing his goals and ideas, in a fruitless intent to adjust and be loved.</li>
      <li>this person will innerly experience an explosion of feelings and emotions, seemingly unable to sustain or control in the long run. Their response to the world´s stimuli will be permanently modified and will never acheive real change because they don´t persevere in their actions and will abandon everything half way, frustrating them step by step. (<span class="textRed">Constant change of strategy</span>). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Instability by Shortage</h4>
    <p>Relation to the world (Tendency): <span class="textGreen">Surrender/Subordination/Vulnerability</span> <br />
  Relation to himself (Experience): <span class="textRed">Distress by Inhibition</span>.</p>
<p>Lack of harmony may also lead him to a <strong>Shortage</strong> condition. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In this case a deep sensitivity, that overwhelms the individual, turns him emotionally unstable and he will seek like never before <span class="textGreen">other people´s protection</span>. In this condition he will set aside all that he was after and shelter in  himself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, people from Symmetry Order 2, who find themselves disturbed either by defect or excess feel <span class="textGreen">vulnerable</span>, unwilling to express themselves, sheltering themselves from the exterior world. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Locked up internally, they feel <span class="textRed">inhibited</span> to act and <span class="textRed">distress</span> will prevail.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>When a person who responds to Symmetry Order 2 suffers an Instability Phase
by <strong>shortage </strong>, the following may appear:</p>
  <p>Inner Nature/Restoration/Rescue:<br />
  <span class="textBlue">Resistance to the environment. Inclusion. Rejection. Permanent and excessive control.</span></p>
    <p>Thus some of these individuals appeal to their mineral nature, which had remained latent until then:    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>that is why they ususally react trying to <span class="textBlue">control</span> that which might present a threat or put him at risk. It´s an inefficient decission, not born out of an unpremeditate impulse, but searching to <span class="textBlue">control any new circumstance</span>. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> <br />
  <strong>Synopsis</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This makes evident the instability of these deteminations: </li>
  </ul>
    <p>People responding to Symmetry Order 2 facing an extreme situation: at first will <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> searching for <span class="textRed">different strategies</span> for tackling effectively different circumstances or will <span class="textGreen">subordinate</span> in <span class="textRed">distress</span> and when the situation gets really extreme, they try and put it under their thumb, neutralizing it, trying to learn more about it, <span class="textBlue">controlling</span> it with uneffective results.</p>

  <p>People responding to symmetry order 4:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Possibly at first sight or in a subtle quick approach, these people won´t call your attention. They are simple, calm, <span class="textBlue">stable</span> people (<u>Necessary condition</u>) they do not tend to stand out from the crowd.  They usually do not outshine in the groups they mingle nor bring about disagreements  but are perfectly <span class="textBlue">integrated</span> (<u>WorldDesideratum</u>) and rarely do they get out of <span class="textBlue">bounds</span> (<u>Theme</u>) aiming at preserving their <span class="textBlue">life-structure</span> (<u>Relation to the world</u>). </li>
    <li>Nevertheless a deeper chat or a keener look into their crafts, professions or hobbies will open the door to a new world which is, <span class="textRed">active</span> (<span class="textRed">Patrimony</span>) and <span class="textRed">constantly brewing</span> in <span class="textRed">search of variables of expression</span> (<u>Necessary condition</u>) Just as a volcanoes - during their stillness might deceive the unadverted eye, thinking they are inert while they are really keeping an intense and ever changing interior activity – they hide a rich inner universe.</li>
    <li>Men and women of this deteremination have a <span class="textBlue">tidy</span> and <span class="textBlue">kempt look</span>, but are not fussy nor obsessed with their appearance.  On the contrary, they are always tuned with the rest and may use the same clothes for years or buy similar ones when renewing their wardrobe.</li>
    <li>They are also very <span class="textBlue">firm in their opinions</span> and it´s hard to make them change their minds.  They often are obstinate in their beleifs and rarely seen loosing control.  They may even be undergoing a great grief or profound happinness, without anyone noticing it in the daily interaction, given that seldom do they express, neither phisically nor verbally, their frames of mind their hopes or fears.</li>
    <li>For these people, there seems to exist a sort of <span class="textBlue">boundary</span> in their roundabouts,  which they cannot trespass but internally they seek for <span class="textRed">inner expansion</span>. They will always try to expand their <span class="textRed">animal heart</span>, always trying <span class="textRed">expand</span> their <span class="textBlue">boundaries</span> , taking their actions a step further.</li>
    <li>It is through the <span class="textRed">development of their creative activities</span> (<u>Theme</u>) that they let go and expand their individuality.</li>
    <li>They usually are great artists, architects and engineers and are successful in everything related to creation, be it of tangible objects or pieces of music or literary work.  Often their tastes and techniques are hard to classify, because they tend to <span class="textRed">create new ways</span> and <span class="textRed">alternatives</span> in their work.  They show <span class="textRed">versatility</span> in these creations <u>(Individual Desideratum</u>) but in a quiet, non flamboyant way. </li>
    <li>So,, this <span class="textRed">versatility</span> facing changes, taking place in their environments, allows them to no longer act, in order to change circumstances but, choose to modify their interior instead and their produce, so that it adjusts to oncoming changes. That is why he is also a great <span class="textRed">novelty</span> (Experience), which he invents when circumstances force him to. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Owing to this articulation: <strong class="textBlue">mineral to the world</strong> and <span class="textRed"><strong>animal heart</strong></span>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They want <span class="textBlue">to be accepted</span> for their <span class="textRed">acts</span>. Deep down, they want to spark up an admiration that has nothing to do with self-indulgence nor gloating per se; but to know that others appreciate <span class="textRed">what's been accomplished</span> with time and effort. </li>
    <li>It´s within this endeavour that they <span class="textBlue">bind</span> themselves to a certain side of reality and due to their animal hearts they tend to perform <span class="textRed">many actions</span>, expanding reality, in their search for acceptance through their works and deeds.</li>
    <li>That´s why they will try <span class="textBlue">integration</span> to the world in order to <span class="textRed">develop their versatility</span>,as a main goal in their lives.</li>
    <li>Therefore, this tendency towards <span class="textBlue">invariability</span> in the way he has <span class="textBlue">structured</span> his life, means to find his <span class="textRed">novelty</span> in the projection to the world
    of the Non Conscious purpose of his <strong class="textGreen">Vegetal Nature</strong>: to manifest the <span class="textGreen">Sensitivity of Transformation</span>. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>Instability Phase</strong><strong> </strong><br />
    <strong>(inharmony)</strong></h3>
  <h4><strong>Instability by Excess</strong></h4>
  <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textBlue">Tendency</span>): <span class="textBlue">Resistance to the environment/Inclusion or Rejection</span>.<br />
    Relation to himself (<span class="textRed">Experience</span>): <span class="textRed">Constant change of strategies</span>. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  When a person responding to symmetry order 4 enters an Instability Phase by <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>some of their traits will be enhanced and frustration will prevail given that he will not be able <span class="textBlue">to integrate</span> to the environment nor to others. </li>
    <li>In this case, he breeds a <span class="textBlue">resistance</span> to everything around him or may well violently <span class="textBlue">reject</span> his environment, or generate himself a <span class="textBlue">forced inclusion</span>. In both cases this is not brought about through actual acts of facts but, through different internal attitudes by means of which, he intends to obtain an artificial harmony, with no results at all.</li>
    <li>He will try to win acceptance by the only way he knows, <span class="textRed">actions</span> from his internal world.  Nevertheless, his confusion will make him, not sure of himself, rapidly feel frustrated, rehearsing different and <span class="textRed">constant strategies</span> of <span class="textBlue">forced inclusion</span> or of <span class="textBlue">exclusion</span>, with no result of either of them. </li>
    <li>His animal heart, might never set his head at rest and spend all the time <span class="textRed">scheming new plans</span> that never give shape or are left half-way.</li>
    <li>This broadens the conflict between an animal heart, that keeps him actively in touch with himself and must work to get to know himself and his external attitude prone to stillness, rest and passivity. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <h4><strong>Instability by Shortage</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Relation to the world(Tendency): <span class="textBlue">Contraction</span>. </li>
    <li>Relation to himself (Experience): <span class="textRed">Distress by inhibition</span><strong>.</strong>  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Inharmonic conditions may also lead him to a <strong>Shortage</strong> situation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In this case the individual <span class="textBlue">isolates</span> himself finding shelter in his inner-self. These are those <span class="textBlue">contraction</span> moments when he closes himself to others and decides to shut off from any external bond.  His way of adjusting and not being out of key, is no longer by making efforts to please but, trying to pass unadverted and not making contact.  Away from the look of others and not counting with their advise, they will try to make themeselves invisible, to be able to stay far away.</li>
    <li>They become isolated and a prevailing strong state of inhibition and distress takes over his life. Like this <span class="textRed">inhibited</span> they present themselves to their companions in tasks and work and also to their families, friends and beloved ones. </li>
    <li>Eventhough depending on them, they continue to search for <span class="textBlue">acceptance</span>, In this determination, this person will decide to stay away from the rest, to <span class="textBlue">contract</span> in himself during the period of <span class="textRed">distress</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When a person responding to symmetry order 4, suffers an instability phase by <strong>Shortage </strong>, this may manifest itself:</p>
  <p>Inner Nature/Restoration/Rescue:</p>
  <p class="textGreen">Altering the environment/Circumstancial Adjustment/Justification</p>
  <p>Thus, some of these individuals will appeal to their <span class="textGreen">vegetal nature</span>, , which has remained latent until then:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>when he is assaulted by this total shortage condition, having reached to a limit, a compensating impulse of <span class="textGreen">vegetal nature</span> will appear. They will react <span class="textGreen">adjusting circumstancially</span> and defending themselves, <span class="textGreen">altering</span> the outer world and <span class="textGreen">justifying</span> these changes, in a fruitless way. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>Synopsis</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>This enforces the instability of these determinations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>people responding to symmetry order 4 facing an extreme situation: at first, they <span class="textBlue">resist</span>, <span class="textBlue">reject</span> or <span class="textBlue">integrate</span> to the new circumstance and look for <span class="textRed">different ways</span> of tackling them effectively, either <span class="textBlue">contracting</span> against the world with <span class="textRed">distress</span> and <span class="textRed">inhibition</span> and when the situation gets really extreme, they usually try to <span class="textGreen">adjust</span>, to naturalize it <span class="textGreen">altering the enviroment</span> and <span class="textGreen">justifying himself</span>, with no results al all.</li>

 <p>People responding to symmetry order 5:</p>
 <ul>
<li> By nature, these people are very restless and vivacious and usually stand out wherever they may be.  They are that sort of people who are possibly in
 <span class="textRed">movement</span> (<u>Necessary condition</u>), from here to there, working actively to be the doers of their own fate and circumstances. </li>
<li> They don´t like anybody to impose rules nor conditions upon them but are willing to open their own path in the world, they <span class="textRed">expand</span> (<u>World Desideratum</u>) in every <span class="textRed">space</span> (<u>External theme</u>) so that others take after them for their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> (<u>Inner theme</u>) and thus they may be happier or feel better. </li>
<li> In this way they may stand out in management, or <span class="textRed">leading</span> at the head of companies or groups, where they are loved and respected for their effort for making everybody feel comfortable and at ease.  Generally their ambition has no limits and each achievement is only a step for the <span class="textRed">coverage</span> , of as much as possible, <span class="textRed">of his surroundings</span> (<u>Tendency</u>)</li>
<li> Nevertheless, his vegetal heart will allow an adequate <span class="textGreen">variability</span> (Inner Necessary Condition) measuring the right moment for certain actions, given that they are connected <span class="textGreen">emotionally</span> (Inner theme) to the surrounding circumstances. </li>
<li> In harmony, most of their intents, to overcome situations, will succeed, given that they will know the exact and precise moment when to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span> (<u>Individual Desideratum</u>)or at least know when it´s the time to step aside to favour their<span class="textGreen">emotional</span> preservation (<u>Patrimony</u>).</li>
<li> They also possess, a refined sense of taste and they usually work hard to <span class="textRed">expand</span> their rich and unique inner world, by which they create unique objects implying on them their personal brand. </li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Due to this articulation: <strong class="textRed">animal to the world</strong> and <span class="textGreen"><strong>vegetal heart</strong></span><strong>: </strong></p>
 <ul>
<li> They will want <span class="textRed">to be appreciates</span> for their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span>, which makes them unique and stand out from the rest.  In relation to themselves, these people wish to pass onto posterity for these<span class="textRed">creations</span> but most of all they want <span class="textRed">to be appreciated</span> for their <span class="textGreen">emotions</span> and the way in which they take care and protect others.  They do not only seek for fame and power, but also to be respected and loved for the emotional quality with which they conduct their relatives.</li>
<li> Within this urge, they will search for <span class="textRed">space</span> from <span class="textGreen">variability</span>: meaning they will need that all the space they cover (social activities, family, relations) to be adjusted to their emotional values.  If circumstances favour it, they may get to be great leaders; their actions having a great impact upon their area of influence upto an unthought level.  They are <span class="textGreen">emotional</span> <span class="textRed">leaders</span>, whose legacy may be remembered long after death. </li>
<li> That is why their <span class="textRed">movements</span> will always look for a personal <span class="textGreen">sensitive expression</span>.</li>
<li> That´s why they will try <span class="textRed">expansion</span> in the world to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span>, which is their primordial goal in life.</li>
<li> So, therefore this tendency to <span class="textRed">cover the surroundings</span> means his intention <span class="textGreen">to perpetuate himself</span> in the projection to the world of the Non Conscious purpose of his <strong class="textBlue">Mineral Nature</strong>: to manifest the <span class="textBlue">Perfection of Integrity</span>.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h3><strong>Instability Phase</strong><strong> </strong><br />
 <strong>(inharmonic)</strong></h3>
 <h4><strong>Instability by Excess</strong></h4>
 <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textRed">Tendency</span>): <span class="textRed">Confrontation, Win/Loose. Conquering Spirit.</span><br />
 Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Circumstancial Adjustment. Justification.</span><br />
 <br />
 When a person responding to symmetry order 5 enters an Instability Phase by <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
 <ul>
<li> This will enhance his <span class="textRed">animal</span>strokes; he may turn into someone only willing <span class="textRed">to win</span> at any cost, placing himself in a positin of permanent <span class="textRed">competition</span>, ein places where he can only <span class="textRed">win</span> or <span class="textRed">lose</span> under any circumstance.</li>
<li> Nevertheless, he manages <span class="textGreen">to adjust</span> thanks to his vegetal heart and also having a good enough nose to keep on varying circumstances of struggle and conquest. The intensity of his experiences make these <span class="textGreen">adjustments cicumstancial</span> and temporary and therefore of very little use, ending up in frustration and deception.</li>
<li>In the long run, his actions at this extent of excess, depend upon a sea of <span class="textRed">feelings</span> in which he <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> to whatever may come next, ending up in a barren and at times harmful chaos, for himself and to others around him, methodically <span class="textGreen">justifying</span> himself for his conduct.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h4><strong>Instability by Shortage</strong></h4>
 <ul>
<li> Relation to the world (<span class="textRed">Tendency</span>): <span class="textRed">Submission. Surrender. Hindrance.</span> </li>
<li> Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Fear and hesitation</span>. </li>
</ul>
 <p>Lack of harmony may also lead him to a <strong>Shortage</strong> condition:</p>
 <ul>
<li> His animal nature leaves him <span class="textRed">helpless</span>, fearing others and in a state of complete submission , where his born leader qualities have disappeared and are left buried, abandoning him to the mercy of others.</li>
<li> His <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> has turned to <span class="textGreen">fear</span>, in a <span class="textGreen">hesitating</span> condition, that leads him to <span class="textRed">surrender</span>, meaning that he will consciously and voluntarily hand over his affairs to others, those against which he would have fought or defied at another time.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When a person responding to symmetry order 5 suffers an instability phase by <strong>Shortage </strong>, this may manifest itself:</p>
 <p>Inner Nature/Restoration/Rescue:<br />
  <span class="textBlue">Resistance to the environment. Inclusion. Rejection. Constant and excessive control.</span></p>
 <p>In this way, some of these individuals appeal to their <span class="textBlue">mineral</span>, nature, which has remained latent until then:</p>
 <ul>
<li> when total shortage takes place, his <span class="textBlue">mineral</span>, nature will appear to the rescue, pushing him to <span class="textBlue">control</span> the external world and circumstances, in such an <span class="textBlue">excessive</span> way but wrongly directed and in vain.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Synopsis</strong> </h3>
 <p>This makes evident the instability of these determinations: </p>
 <ul>
<li> people responding to symmetry order 5, facing an extreme situation: at first they <span class="textRed">confront</span>, <span class="textRed">fight</span> appealing to all the <span class="textGreen">emotional variables</span> they possess or <span class="textRed">voluntarily submit</span>, they <span class="textRed">surrender</span>, by <span class="textGreen">fear</span> and <span class="textGreen">hesitation</span>.

    People responding to symmetry order 6:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
An individual of this symmetry order will tend to be closely in touch with his
<span class="textGreen">sensibility</span>(Necessary Condition towards the world) and alert to the world and to those people around him. Probably susceptible to changes going on in any of the fields in which they move around – at work, family or emotional-, for example: where they are bound to be appreciated and loved for their good <span class="textGreen">response</span> (Tendency) and for their capability to <span class="textGreen">change</span> their stands and decisions <span class="textGreen">adjusting</span> (Theme in the world) on behalf of their relation to others.</li>
		<li>
			Affectionate and attentive to others, these people may spend a long time pondering and in general are very keen on drawing conclusions about others and on moving ahead to future events.  If they set their minds to it, they may reach to be excellent political or financial analysts, welfare workers or art critics.</li>
		<li>
  Due to this ability to change along with the world around him, most of the times they are prepared for unstable situations, given the nature they make use of, they are able to keep afloat <span class="textGreen">transforming</span> reality (World Desideratum) even in the worse scenarios or most drastic movements.</li>
		<li>Nevertheless, deep in their hearts, they wish to be acknowledged for their individuality and personality trying to be <span class="textGreen">loved</span> for those <span class="textBlue">qualities that make them unique</span>.</li>
		<li>They will try to keep up their <span class="textBlue">identity stability</span> (Experience) resisting any external influence willing to change them. In fact their actions and works might be recognized because on them is their author´s brand, a permanent signature of their style.</li>
		<li>The <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> with which they interrealate with the world, must
      work on behalf of his mineral heart, asking him to assimilate all this into his <span class="textBlue">identity</span>. This may take place when putting in order the sensitive world by an inner calssification, where they will also want to leave their brand as a witness for their <span class="textGreem">sensitivity</span>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Due to this articulation: <strong class="textGreen">vegetal to the world</strong> and <span class="textBlue"><strong>mineral heart</strong></span><strong>:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>they will want <span class="textGreen">to be loved</span> for their <span class="textBlue">individuality</span> and <span class="textBlue">personality</span>, those qualities that make them unique and make them stand out from the rest.</li>
		<li>With this urge they will seek to <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> to circumstances from within their<span class="textBlue">structure</span>: meaning they will need all their <span class="textGreen">actions</span> (social activities, family, affections), to be perfectly ruled and structured.  They will set their actions in order with an inner classification <span class="textGreen">adjusting</span>to reality with their <span class="textBlue">personal brand</span>.</li>
		<li>This is how by means of the <span class="textGreen">dependent sensitivity</span> by which their lives are ruled, they will search for personal <span class="textBlue">consolidation</span>.</li>
		<li>That is why they will try to <span class="textGreen">transform</span> the world in order to attain <span class="textBlue">perfection</span> the primordial goal of their lives.</li>
		<li>That´s why this tendency for <span class="textGreen">response</span> and <span class="textGreen">instability</span> facing circumstances, makes their <span class="textBlue">identity stability</span> possible, when projecting to the world the Non Conscious Purpose of their <strong class="textRed">Animal Nature</strong>: to manifest the <span class="textRed">Versatility of Expansion</span>.</li>

	<h3>Instability Phase<br />
		(inharmonic)</h3>
<h4>
		Instability by Excess</h4>
  <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textGreen">Tendency</span>): <span class="textGreen">Altering the environment</span>.<br />
  Relation to himself (<span class="textBlue">Experience</span>): <span class="textBlue">Permanent and excessive control</span>.  </p>
<p>When a person responding to symmetry order 6 suffers an Instability Phase by <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>they will keep on <span class="textGreen">altering</span> different and  <span class="textGreen">instable actions</span> according to what´s going on around them.  He lives in a <span class="textGreen">variable</span> atmosphere where he can easily shift from one mood to another, enclosed in a flow of feelings and experiences that might play him more than a few mishaps.</li>
		<li>He will feel the need of exerting an <span class="textBlue">excessive control</span> over everything going on.  Possibly he will make a <span class="textBlue">great effort</span> to be in command of the situations he finds himself in, not with a conquering spirit and blindly looking for success but as someone wanting <span class="textBlue">to keep things</span> in such a state that he may know and anticipate.</li>
		<li>Rarely will he take action tending to take the lead of events he might even become a spectator longing to be the "know it all" person.  This is about a fruitless effort to keep everything under his wing, trying different possibilities and options to attain this.</li>
</ul>
	<h4>
		Instability by Shortage</h4>
	<p>Relation to the world (<span class="textGreen">Tendency</span>): <span class="textGreen">Subordination. Surrender.Vulnerability</span>.<br />
		Relation to himself (<span class="textBlue">Experience</span>): <span class="textBlue">Anxiety of devastation</span>.</p>
	<p>When a person responding to symmetry order 6 suffers an Instability
Phase by <strong>Shortage</strong>:</p>
	<p>Instability will manifest itself as it shows in an individual of a vegetal-mineral nature, in shortage:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lack of harmony by shortage, will take away any possibility of taking hold of a situation and will a affect his entire sensitivity. He may even present a <span class="textGreen">subordinate</span> condition to circumstances with an absolute and deep feeling of <span class="textGreen">surrender</span> leaving him completely <span class="textGreen">vulnerable</span> to others.</li>
		<li>It´s s sort of anxiety together with a profound feeling of rupture, a point of no return (<span class="textBlue">anxiety of devastation</span>) that overwhelms him, leaving him totally subordinate, defeated and prone to give it all up, feeling he can´t hold on anymore.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When a person responding to symmetry order 6 suffers an instability phase by shortage, this may become manifest:</p>
	<p>Inner Nature/restoration/rescue:</p>
	<p class="textRed">Confrontation. Win/Loose. Conquering Spirit/Change of strategies</p>
  <p>In this way, some of these individuals appeal to their <span class="textRed">animal</span>, nature, that had remained latent until then:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Facing an extreme situation and amidst this scenery, possibly his "<span class="textRed">animality</span>"resting in his inner nature will come to the rescue, making him undergo numerous, fast, unexpected actions but, at the same time inefficient, surprising everybody with an ability to quarrel, to fight back and an unique resistance.  Nevertheless this rescue mission, will rarely prove effective and the energy required to bring about this restoration is almost always never enough.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Synopsis</h3>
	<p>This  confirms the instability of these determinations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>people responding to symmetry order 6 facing an extreme situation: at first they will <span class="textGreen">alter the environment</span> appealing to <span class="textBlue">excessive control</span> of all the <span class="textBlue">varying emotions</span> they possess or <span class="textGreen">vulnerable</span> they will <span class="textGreen">subordinate</span> and <span class="textGreen">surrender</span>. Facing the new situation they find themselves in a condition where <span class="textBlue">anxiety of devastation</span>will prevail. When the situation turns extreme they usually try to <span class="textRed">confront reality</span> trying to <span class="textRed">conquer it</span> appealing to a <span class="textRed">permanent change of strategies</span> in a fruitless way.</li>

 <p>People responding to symmetry order 8:</p>
 <ul>
<li> may be recognized for their apparent discretion and simplicity, and their <span class="textBlue">stability</span> (<u>Necessary condition to the world</u>) and they are always working to guide their lives on works through which they will feel <span class="textBlue">integrated</span> (<u>World Desideratum</u>)to reality and might outlive them so as to leave a legacy of their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> (<u>Inner theme</u>). </li>
<li> They are not very talkative with strangers, not very showy, often submerged in their own thoughts and ideas. They integrate to the group they belong to, that makes the <span class="textBlue">structure</span> of his life almost <span class="textBlue">invariable</span> (<span class="textBlue"><u>Tendencia</u></span>).</li>
<li> AThey love it peace and quiet, in many cases almost absolutely. These people find in their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> (Inner theme) refuge from the world. They enjoy sitting quietly reading a book, watching films on T.V. or they may spend the whole morning pondering about new plans and ideas.</li>
<li> Though they seem to live in a lonely world, once they gain confidence, they reveal themselves as really loving and honouring their own work, eager to improve their skills and profession, often getting <span class="textGreen">perfectionist</span> and obsessive about details; having a great ability <span class="textGreen">to vary</span> (<u>Necessary inner condition</u>)the emotional guide-line of their purposes within their life-structure.</li>
<li> These people do not ususally dream with long trips or to stand out in some sport, they do wish to keep on nourishing their intellect or improving their art-skills, to accomplish astonishing works that will make them part of to the communities or groups they aspire to belong to, because deep in their hearts they long to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span> (<u>Individual Desideratum</u>). </li>
<li> They may be great art-followers, in any of its expressions and usually show a refined and exquisite taste in every sphere of their lives. They are often that kind of person, with the prompt and good advise, usually surprising with their unique and useful remarks, witnessing they have not lived their lives in vain, as an intent for <span class="textGreen">their own perpetuation</span> (<u>Experience</u>) through these actions. </li>
<li> They usually don´t talk about what they don´t know and finding themselves surrounded by people they don´t hold many points in common, they usually withdraw and may get lost in their own thoughts.  In fact, it is not unfrequent that they arise from this apparent absence, enticed by a new idea or the solution to a problem that had kept them worried.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
 Due to this articulation: <strong class="textBlue">mineral to the world</strong> and <span class="textGreen"><strong>vegetal heart</strong></span><strong>:</strong></p>
 <ul>
<li> They will wish <span class="textBlue">to be accepted</span> for their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> for their <span class="textGreen">emotional abilities</span> that make them unique and stand out from the rest. </li>
<li> Within that desire they will look for <span class="textBlue">boundaries</span> in their <span class="textGreen">variability</span>: meaning they will need to clearly define which is the limit for every circumstance in (social, family, emotional activities). They will put in order their actions and creativity, as if needing to know the right perspective of  possibilities within reality.</li>
<li> That's why from this <span class="textBlue">stability</span> they will always try and express their inner <span class="textGreen">sensibility</span>.</li>
<li> That´s why they will look for <span class="textBlue">integration</span> in the world, to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span> as a primordial goal in their lives.</li>
<li> Therefore this tendency to move within the <span class="textBlue">structure invariability</span> implies the possibility of expressing their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span>& projecting to the world the Non conscious purpose of their <strong class="textRed">Animal Nature</strong>: manifesting the <span class="textRed">Versatility of expansion</span>. </li>
</ul>
 <h3 ><strong>Instability Phase </strong><br />
 <strong>&nbsp;(inharmonic)</strong></h3>
 <h4 ><strong>Instability by Excess</strong></h4>
 <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textBlue">Tendency</span>): <span class="textBlue">Resistance to the environment. Inclusion. Rejection</span>. <br />
 Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Circumstancial Adjustment. Justification</span></p>
 <p>When a person reponding to Symmetry order 8 suffers an Instability Phase by
 <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
 <ul>
<li> It will enhance some of the mineral traits in such a way, that in spite of numerous intents, they will never manage to fully <span class="textBlue">integrate</span> the environment nor to others, turning their rich interior universe into a disorganized chaos never managing to fullfil it in a complete work.  It´s the case of those writers who cannot mange to grasp their great potential into a story or a novel, in spite of all the ideas flourishing in their heads. Not being able to produce or to give shape in real life to their wishes, they will appeal to <span class="textGreen">justification</span> for their acts or will <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> depending on the circumstances.</li>
<li> In such a way, his response to the environment will always present a polarity: <span class="textBlue">rejection</span> or <span class="textBlue">forced adjustment</span>. Thus, his heart will determine an <span class="textGreen">adecuación</span> which will only last <span class="textGreen">circumstancially</span> and his relation to the environment will be experienced painfully. </li>
</ul>
 <h3 ><strong>Instability Phase </strong><br />

 <h4 ><strong>Instability by Shortage</strong></h4>
 <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textBlue">Tendency</span>): <span class="textBlue">Contraction</span> <br />
 Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Fear with hesitation</span>.</p>
 <p>When a person responding to symmetry order 8 suffers an Instability Phase
by <strong>Shortage</strong>: </p>
 <ul>
<li> life will find him enclosed within himself, totally <span class="textBlue">contracted</span> into his own boundaries and without self-confidence. They may turn into <span class="textGreen">hesitant</span>, persons, who seem to have lost their inspiration and the north that guided their lives. In meetings, they seem absent but not because their thoughts are elsewhere but because they have been caught by melancholy for no apparent reason. A deep <span class="textGreen">hesitation</span> has appeared, leaving them helpless.</li>
</ul>
 <p>When a person who responds to symmetry 8 suffers an Instability Phase by <strong>Shortage </strong> the following manifests itself:</p>
 <ul>
<li> Inner Nature/restoration/rescue:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
 <p><span class="textRed">Confrontation. Win/Loose. Conquest spirit. Constant change of strategies.</span><br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
 So, some of these individuals  appeal to their animal nature which has remained
dormant until then:</p>
 <ul>
<li> These people under a shortage situation usually try to alter the situations that produced them, eventhough they may not evaluate the consequences that this might bring.</li>
<li> That is why they usually react almost instinctively, without giving it a second thought in a purely reflex move by means of which they only wish to survive, revealing a change in their own personal traits that will permanently <span class="textRed">confront</span> them to the world in an unhappy, inefficient way. </li>
</ul>
 <h3 ><strong>Synopsis</strong></h3>
 <p>This gives shape to the instability of these determinations: </p>
 <ul>
<li> people responding to symmetry 8 facing an extreme situation: at first <span class="textBlue">resist inclusion</span> or <span class="textBlue">reject it</span>, appealin to any sort of <span class="textGreen">circumstancial adjustment, justifying himself</span> or will voluntarily <span class="textBlue">ccontact within himself</span> facing the new circumstance they will find themselves in a condition where <span class="textGreen">fear</span> and <span class="textGreen">hesitation</span> prevails. When the situation gets really extreme they usually try and <span class="textRed">confront reality</span> trying to <span class="textRed">conquer it</span> appealing to <span class="textRed">constant change of strategies</span> in a fruitless way.</li>
