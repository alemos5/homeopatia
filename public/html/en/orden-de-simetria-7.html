	<h2><strong>Simmetry Dynamics</strong></h2>
    <p>The manifestation Phases of the different  simmetries, are under no doubt, dynamic, meaning not static.</p>
    <p>It all depends on the individual&acute;s  interaction with its environment, regarding the different circumstances and  their corresponding influence.</p>
    <p>So much so, both the 2 Phases and their 4  Determinations, may vary from one circumstance to another.</p>
    <p>At times one may be in harmony,&nbsp; then undergo an excess or a shortage, facing  different situations or eventualities.</p>
    <p>Then the Stability Phase might imply  harmony, where the individual ought to be at its peak, depending on their own  singularities and individual talents.</p>
    <p>When an individual gets stuck in any of the  Instability Phase Determinations, he will then start losing integral harmony.&nbsp; This lack of harmony will distort his  perception of reality, as if&nbsp; watching  through a prism, thus originating a totally different way of feeling and  interacting in the world.</p>

		Symmetry Order 7 Dynamics</h2>
		As we may well see, in the following chart, in the symmetry order 7, relation to the world and to himself, are shared by the animal and vegetal realms.   Whoever may possess this symmetry, may show a 2 or 5 behaviour; therefore only the clynical study will determine to which of these two symmetries he belongs to.</p>

  <p>People responding to Symmetry Order 2:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are very  <span class="textGreen">affectionate</span> and <span class="textGreen">caring</span>, persons, who ususally are aware of everything going on around them, being that their  <u>necessary condition</u> towards the world is  <span class="textGreen">emotional dependance</span>. </li>
    <li>They are alert persons, remembering everything that we tell them, and may surprise us with their memory for details, for example: if they invite us for dinner at their place, they won´t forget our favorite dish, how much sugar we take with our coffee, the after-dinner chat, etc.</li>
    <li>They are always informed about what´s going on around them – in touch with all current news - also within their family and at work.</li>
    <li>These people  <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> (<u>Theme</u>)rapidly to changes and do not fear unstable conditions, being that they are verstile enough so as to always have the right and ready word or attitude.  In that way they may always hold an amiable chat with their boss or top manager in their firm, with the same candour and attention as with their most modest employee. </li>
    <li>Their ability to <span class="textGreen">respond</span> (<u>Tendency</u>) and for <span class="textGreen">transformation</span> (<u> World Desideratum</u>)facing other people´s actions and movements, is admirable, but rarely is he the promotor of a massive change, but mostly someone who tags along without outshining or being out of key.</li>
    <li>Given his <span class="rel_rojo">animal heart</span> the same verstility he shows for changes is put into action, thanks to his relentless <span class="textRed">creativity</span> (<u>Theme</u>), by which he manages to bring forth unique objects and pieces, his <span class="textRed">novelty</span> (<u>Experience</u>), often created and meant for a person in particular or for solving a specific situation.</li>
    <li>They are  excellent hosts and stand out in those activities in which they have to actively render service, like teaching in all its levels, any tourism branch like hotel-service and even trades such as fireman or rescue worker.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Due to this articulation: <span class="textGreen"><strong>vegetal</strong> <strong>towards the world</strong></span> and <span class="textRed"> <strong>animal</strong> <strong>heart</strong></span>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They desire <span class="textGreen">to be loved</span> for their <span class="textRed">acts</span>. These people deep in their heart, look for love and
 <span class="textGreen">affection</span> through the things they produce.</li>
    <li>To fulfil this yearning they <span class="textGreen">adjust</span>, yand due to their animal heart they tend to bring about numerous <span class="textRed">modifications</span> in their doings always under the inflluence of their emotions and their search for affection. This multiplies their interests and actions.</li>
    <li>That is why they need to <span class="textGreen">depend emotionally</span> on their environment for their <span class="textRed">creations</span>.</li>
    <li>That is why they will try to <span class="textGreen">transform</span> the world, in order to <span class="textRed">develop their versatility</span>, as primordial goal in their lives.</li>
    <li>So the meaning of this tendency for <span class="textGreen">response</span> and <span class="textGreen">instability</span>, is to find his <span class="textRed">novelty</span>, to project to the world the Non Conscious Purpose of his <strong class="textBlue">Mineral Nature</strong>: to manifest the <span class="textBlue">Perfection of Integrity</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
	  Instability Phase<br />
  (inharmonic)</h3>
  <h4>
		Instability by Excess</h4>
  <p>Relation to the world (Tendency): <span class="textGreen">Altering the environment</span>. </p>
  <p>Relation to himself (Experience): <span class="textRed">Altering the environment</span>. </p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>When a person responding to Symmetry Order 2 enters an Instability Phase by<strong>Excess</strong>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>He will enhance an unrestrained and unstable tendency  to adjust externally (vegetal characteristic) (<span class="textGreen">Altering the environment adjustment</span>). His mood transformed, he turns impredictable, without apparently noticing what´s going on around him. Beyond what happens to others, he will try to please, eagerly changing his goals and ideas, in a fruitless intent to adjust and be loved.</li>
      <li>this person will innerly experience an explosion of feelings and emotions, seemingly unable to sustain or control in the long run. Their response to the world´s stimuli will be permanently modified and will never acheive real change because they don´t persevere in their actions and will abandon everything half way, frustrating them step by step. (<span class="textRed">Constant change of strategy</span>). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Instability by Shortage</h4>
    <p>Relation to the world (Tendency): <span class="textGreen">Surrender/Subordination/Vulnerability</span> <br />
  Relation to himself (Experience): <span class="textRed">Distress by Inhibition</span>.</p>
<p>Lack of harmony may also lead him to a <strong>Shortage</strong> condition. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In this case a deep sensitivity, that overwhelms the individual, turns him emotionally unstable and he will seek like never before <span class="textGreen">other people´s protection</span>. In this condition he will set aside all that he was after and shelter in  himself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, people from Symmetry Order 2, who find themselves disturbed either by defect or excess feel <span class="textGreen">vulnerable</span>, unwilling to express themselves, sheltering themselves from the exterior world. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Locked up internally, they feel <span class="textRed">inhibited</span> to act and <span class="textRed">distress</span> will prevail.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>When a person who responds to Symmetry Order 2 suffers an Instability Phase
by <strong>shortage </strong>, the following may appear:</p>
  <p>Inner Nature/Restoration/Rescue:<br />
  <span class="textBlue">Resistance to the environment. Inclusion. Rejection. Permanent and excessive control.</span></p>
    <p>Thus some of these individuals appeal to their mineral nature, which had remained latent until then:    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>that is why they ususally react trying to <span class="textBlue">control</span> that which might present a threat or put him at risk. It´s an inefficient decission, not born out of an unpremeditate impulse, but searching to <span class="textBlue">control any new circumstance</span>. </li>
    </ul>

    <li>This makes evident the instability of these deteminations: </li>

    <p>People responding to Symmetry Order 2 facing an extreme situation: at first will <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> searching for <span class="textRed">different strategies</span> for tackling effectively different circumstances or will <span class="textGreen">subordinate</span> in <span class="textRed">distress</span> and when the situation gets really extreme, they try and put it under their thumb, neutralizing it, trying to learn more about it, <span class="textBlue">controlling</span> it with uneffective results.</p>

 <p>People responding to symmetry order 5:</p>
 <ul>
<li> By nature, these people are very restless and vivacious and usually stand out wherever they may be.  They are that sort of people who are possibly in
 <span class="textRed">movement</span> (<u>Necessary condition</u>), from here to there, working actively to be the doers of their own fate and circumstances. </li>
<li> They don´t like anybody to impose rules nor conditions upon them but are willing to open their own path in the world, they <span class="textRed">expand</span> (<u>World Desideratum</u>) in every <span class="textRed">space</span> (<u>External theme</u>) so that others take after them for their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> (<u>Inner theme</u>) and thus they may be happier or feel better. </li>
<li> In this way they may stand out in management, or <span class="textRed">leading</span> at the head of companies or groups, where they are loved and respected for their effort for making everybody feel comfortable and at ease.  Generally their ambition has no limits and each achievement is only a step for the <span class="textRed">coverage</span> , of as much as possible, <span class="textRed">of his surroundings</span> (<u>Tendency</u>)</li>
<li> Nevertheless, his vegetal heart will allow an adequate <span class="textGreen">variability</span> (Inner Necessary Condition) measuring the right moment for certain actions, given that they are connected <span class="textGreen">emotionally</span> (Inner theme) to the surrounding circumstances. </li>
<li> In harmony, most of their intents, to overcome situations, will succeed, given that they will know the exact and precise moment when to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span> (<u>Individual Desideratum</u>)or at least know when it´s the time to step aside to favour their<span class="textGreen">emotional</span> preservation (<u>Patrimony</u>).</li>
<li> They also possess, a refined sense of taste and they usually work hard to <span class="textRed">expand</span> their rich and unique inner world, by which they create unique objects implying on them their personal brand. </li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Due to this articulation: <strong class="textRed">animal to the world</strong> and <span class="textGreen"><strong>vegetal heart</strong></span><strong>: </strong></p>
 <ul>
<li> They will want <span class="textRed">to be appreciates</span> for their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span>, which makes them unique and stand out from the rest.  In relation to themselves, these people wish to pass onto posterity for these<span class="textRed">creations</span> but most of all they want <span class="textRed">to be appreciated</span> for their <span class="textGreen">emotions</span> and the way in which they take care and protect others.  They do not only seek for fame and power, but also to be respected and loved for the emotional quality with which they conduct their relatives.</li>
<li> Within this urge, they will search for <span class="textRed">space</span> from <span class="textGreen">variability</span>: meaning they will need that all the space they cover (social activities, family, relations) to be adjusted to their emotional values.  If circumstances favour it, they may get to be great leaders; their actions having a great impact upon their area of influence upto an unthought level.  They are <span class="textGreen">emotional</span> <span class="textRed">leaders</span>, whose legacy may be remembered long after death. </li>
<li> That is why their <span class="textRed">movements</span> will always look for a personal <span class="textGreen">sensitive expression</span>.</li>
<li> That´s why they will try <span class="textRed">expansion</span> in the world to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span>, which is their primordial goal in life.</li>
<li> So, therefore this tendency to <span class="textRed">cover the surroundings</span> means his intention <span class="textGreen">to perpetuate himself</span> in the projection to the world of the Non Conscious purpose of his <strong class="textBlue">Mineral Nature</strong>: to manifest the <span class="textBlue">Perfection of Integrity</span>.</li>

 <h3><strong>Instability Phase</strong><strong> </strong><br />

 Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Circumstancial Adjustment. Justification.</span><br />
 <br />
 When a person responding to symmetry order 5 enters an Instability Phase by <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
 <ul>
<li> This will enhance his <span class="textRed">animal</span>strokes; he may turn into someone only willing <span class="textRed">to win</span> at any cost, placing himself in a positin of permanent <span class="textRed">competition</span>, ein places where he can only <span class="textRed">win</span> or <span class="textRed">lose</span> under any circumstance.</li>
<li> Nevertheless, he manages <span class="textGreen">to adjust</span> thanks to his vegetal heart and also having a good enough nose to keep on varying circumstances of struggle and conquest. The intensity of his experiences make these <span class="textGreen">adjustments cicumstancial</span> and temporary and therefore of very little use, ending up in frustration and deception.</li>
<li>In the long run, his actions at this extent of excess, depend upon a sea of <span class="textRed">feelings</span> in which he <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> to whatever may come next, ending up in a barren and at times harmful chaos, for himself and to others around him, methodically <span class="textGreen">justifying</span> himself for his conduct.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h4><strong>Instability by Shortage</strong></h4>
 <ul>
<li> Relation to the world (<span class="textRed">Tendency</span>): <span class="textRed">Submission. Surrender. Hindrance.</span> </li>
<li> Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Fear and hesitation</span>. </li>
</ul>
 <p>Lack of harmony may also lead him to a <strong>Shortage</strong> condition:</p>
 <ul>
<li> His animal nature leaves him <span class="textRed">helpless</span>, fearing others and in a state of complete submission , where his born leader qualities have disappeared and are left buried, abandoning him to the mercy of others.</li>
<li> His <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> has turned to <span class="textGreen">fear</span>, in a <span class="textGreen">hesitating</span> condition, that leads him to <span class="textRed">surrender</span>, meaning that he will consciously and voluntarily hand over his affairs to others, those against which he would have fought or defied at another time.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When a person responding to symmetry order 5 suffers an instability phase by <strong>Shortage </strong>, this may manifest itself:</p>
 <p>Inner Nature/Restoration/Rescue:<br />
  <span class="textBlue">Resistance to the environment. Inclusion. Rejection. Constant and excessive control.</span></p>
 <p>In this way, some of these individuals appeal to their <span class="textBlue">mineral</span>, nature, which has remained latent until then:</p>
 <ul>
<li> when total shortage takes place, his <span class="textBlue">mineral</span>, nature will appear to the rescue, pushing him to <span class="textBlue">control</span> the external world and circumstances, in such an <span class="textBlue">excessive</span> way but wrongly directed and in vain.</li>

<h3><strong>Synopsis</strong> </h3>
 <p>This makes evident the instability of these determinations: </p>
