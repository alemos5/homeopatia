				<p>
					In the 2014 Algorithmic Study you are able to vary the patient's data. This option alow the homeopath to do more than one study for a patient if you have doubts about some of the entered data. With the "Update Data" option you can make this changes.				</p>
				<hr noshade="noshade" />
				<h3>
					2</h3>
				<p>
					The study will first emphasize the <strong>Impregnancy</strong>: an approximation (percentage) to the patient's tendency towards the structure of the mineral, vegetal and animal kingdoms. All sick living creatures meet the characteristics of a certain order established by one of the kingdoms of nature(*). This method is only considered to calculate percentages due to the scarce amount of experimented substances and the large number of matter that has not been tested yet.<br />
					Only the mineral, vegetal and animal kingdoms will be taken into consideration. In recent years the last two kingdoms have been subdivided, but such subdivisions will not be contemplated for the time being; for example: the fungi (mushroom) kingdom is included in the vegetal kingdom.</p>
				<p>
					The Kindoms are :</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Blue for Mineral kingdom.</li>
					<li>
						Green for Vegetable kingdom.</li>
					<li>
						Red for Animal kingdom.				</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Pressing on "<strong>See the Dynamic</strong>" and "<strong>Symmetry Interrogation</strong>" buttons you will be able to analyze the <span id="result_box" lang="en">patient existential</span> dynamic for a better undestanding of the case and, on the other hand, the questions that must be asked during the interrogation to establish a "consonancy" link with the deepest nature of the patient, mostly if the "Impregnology theory" is being used.</p>
				<p>
					When the interrogation lies in the depth of the patient, with the directed questions you will get answers from the patients deep <span id="result_box2" lang="en">awareness</span>. This way the direct questioning behave like a trigger of information.				</p>
				<hr noshade="noshade" />
				<h3>

				<p>
					The "<strong>Combined Analysis</strong>" is the result of the sum of the study values of the current mathematical variables identified so far. Like in a repertorization the remedies that cover most of those variables are grouped, allowing a more dynamic analysis.</p>
				<p>
					Using the "<strong>filters</strong>" you can select the variables you think are best. (experience shows that the best results are when all the variables are used).                    </p>
				<hr noshade="noshade" />
                   <h3>4</h3>
				<p>
					On the <strong>"Extended Analysis"</strong> the study indicates a list of remedies organized according to their hierarchy in the<strong> Mathematical Similarity Rank</strong> (<strong>MSR</strong>). This list determines the <strong>Algorithm</strong> based on the information entered on the patient..</p>
				<p>
					This organization goes from <strong>MSR 9 </strong>(value nine) to <strong>MSR 2 </strong>(value two). Where <strong>MSR 9</strong> is highest in rank and <strong>MSR 2</strong> is lowest in rank.</p>
				<p>
					The first column on the left distinguishes with different colors the kingdom each remedy belongs to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Blue for the Mineral kingdom.</li>
					<li>
						Green for the Vegetable kingdom.</li>
					<li>
						Red for the Animal kingdom.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Those remedies that belong to more than one kingdom will be highlighted with two colors.<br />
					The Candegabe Algorithm shows 3 more columns that highlight with a blue dot the concurrent variables identified to date.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The "<strong>Consonance</strong>".</li>
					<li>
						The <strong>"Key Remedies"</strong></li>
					<li>
						The <strong>"Sequence"</strong>.</li>
				</ul>
				<hr noshade="noshade" />
				<h3>
					5</h3>
				<p>
					If you decide to use the <strong>Extended Analysis</strong> we suggest the following steps to read the results:&nbsp;</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li>
						First step: take a look at the <strong>Impregnancy</strong>.We recommend you read the remedies with the highest <strong>MSR</strong> before you read those with the lowest <strong>MSR</strong> and compare them with the patient.</li>
					<li>
						Second step: compare all remedies pursuant to their <strong>MSR</strong> hierarchy, from the highest values to the lowest values.</li>
					<li>
						We recommend you keep in mind whenever
						<ul>
							<li>
								a remedy that could work with the patient.</li>
							<li>
								there is an unknown remedy.</li>
							<li>
								there ir a known remedy that don't posses the patogenethic dinamic image of the patient.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						"<strong>Consonance</strong>".</li>
					<li>
						The fourth and fifh step will rank the "<strong>Key Remedies</strong>" and the "<strong>Sequence</strong>".</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The remedies selected by the homeopath that have the blue button in the <strong>Consonancy</strong>, <strong>Key Remedy</strong> and <strong>Secuency</strong>, as well as a high <strong>MSR</strong> and <strong>Impregnancy</strong> will be better than the others in this case.				</p>
				<hr noshade="noshade" />
				<h3>
					6</h3>
				<p>
					You can select to see a particular Kingdom if you want to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						We recommend to use this option to check on the "<strong>Impregnancy</strong>".				</li>
				</ul>
				<hr noshade="noshade" />
				<h3>
					7</h3>
				<p>
					Therefore, alter analyzing more than 1500 remedies, the first column on the left shall group a smaller amount of the most accurate remedies and, among those, you should discover the remedy with the pathogenetic image that best matches the dynamic disease of the patient.</p>
				<p>
					The study will be automatically saved on our database and you will be able to recover it on the "<strong>Saved Studies</strong>" menu. You will also be able to save a PDF pressing on "<strong>Download Study</strong>".</p>
				<p>
				If you choose to print the study we recommend to write a small "tick" next to the remedies you think are suitable for the patient.</p></td>
