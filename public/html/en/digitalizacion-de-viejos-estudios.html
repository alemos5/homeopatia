This will also save the studies online so you will always have the lastest version available online.</p>
<p>
	For the digitalization you MUST have the PDF file.</p>
<p>
	The cost of digitalization is $5.- per PDF.</p>
<p>
	If you have a large number of studies to digitalize you can ask for a special price and save money when digitalizing PDF studies all at once.</p>
