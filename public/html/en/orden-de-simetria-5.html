	<h2><strong>Simmetry Dynamics</strong></h2>
    <p>The manifestation Phases of the different  simmetries, are under no doubt, dynamic, meaning not static.</p>
    <p>It all depends on the individual&acute;s  interaction with its environment, regarding the different circumstances and  their corresponding influence.</p>
    <p>So much so, both the 2 Phases and their 4  Determinations, may vary from one circumstance to another.</p>
    <p>At times one may be in harmony,&nbsp; then undergo an excess or a shortage, facing  different situations or eventualities.</p>
    <p>Then the Stability Phase might imply  harmony, where the individual ought to be at its peak, depending on their own  singularities and individual talents.</p>
    <p>When an individual gets stuck in any of the  Instability Phase Determinations, he will then start losing integral harmony.&nbsp; This lack of harmony will distort his  perception of reality, as if&nbsp; watching  through a prism, thus originating a totally different way of feeling and  interacting in the world.</p>

 <p>People responding to symmetry order 5:</p>
 <ul>
<li> By nature, these people are very restless and vivacious and usually stand out wherever they may be.  They are that sort of people who are possibly in
 <span class="textRed">movement</span> (<u>Necessary condition</u>), from here to there, working actively to be the doers of their own fate and circumstances. </li>
<li> They don´t like anybody to impose rules nor conditions upon them but are willing to open their own path in the world, they <span class="textRed">expand</span> (<u>World Desideratum</u>) in every <span class="textRed">space</span> (<u>External theme</u>) so that others take after them for their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> (<u>Inner theme</u>) and thus they may be happier or feel better. </li>
<li> In this way they may stand out in management, or <span class="textRed">leading</span> at the head of companies or groups, where they are loved and respected for their effort for making everybody feel comfortable and at ease.  Generally their ambition has no limits and each achievement is only a step for the <span class="textRed">coverage</span> , of as much as possible, <span class="textRed">of his surroundings</span> (<u>Tendency</u>)</li>
<li> Nevertheless, his vegetal heart will allow an adequate <span class="textGreen">variability</span> (Inner Necessary Condition) measuring the right moment for certain actions, given that they are connected <span class="textGreen">emotionally</span> (Inner theme) to the surrounding circumstances. </li>
<li> In harmony, most of their intents, to overcome situations, will succeed, given that they will know the exact and precise moment when to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span> (<u>Individual Desideratum</u>)or at least know when it´s the time to step aside to favour their<span class="textGreen">emotional</span> preservation (<u>Patrimony</u>).</li>
<li> They also possess, a refined sense of taste and they usually work hard to <span class="textRed">expand</span> their rich and unique inner world, by which they create unique objects implying on them their personal brand. </li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Due to this articulation: <strong class="textRed">animal to the world</strong> and <span class="textGreen"><strong>vegetal heart</strong></span><strong>: </strong></p>
 <ul>
<li> They will want <span class="textRed">to be appreciates</span> for their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span>, which makes them unique and stand out from the rest.  In relation to themselves, these people wish to pass onto posterity for these<span class="textRed">creations</span> but most of all they want <span class="textRed">to be appreciated</span> for their <span class="textGreen">emotions</span> and the way in which they take care and protect others.  They do not only seek for fame and power, but also to be respected and loved for the emotional quality with which they conduct their relatives.</li>
<li> Within this urge, they will search for <span class="textRed">space</span> from <span class="textGreen">variability</span>: meaning they will need that all the space they cover (social activities, family, relations) to be adjusted to their emotional values.  If circumstances favour it, they may get to be great leaders; their actions having a great impact upon their area of influence upto an unthought level.  They are <span class="textGreen">emotional</span> <span class="textRed">leaders</span>, whose legacy may be remembered long after death. </li>
<li> That is why their <span class="textRed">movements</span> will always look for a personal <span class="textGreen">sensitive expression</span>.</li>
<li> That´s why they will try <span class="textRed">expansion</span> in the world to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span>, which is their primordial goal in life.</li>
<li> So, therefore this tendency to <span class="textRed">cover the surroundings</span> means his intention <span class="textGreen">to perpetuate himself</span> in the projection to the world of the Non Conscious purpose of his <strong class="textBlue">Mineral Nature</strong>: to manifest the <span class="textBlue">Perfection of Integrity</span>.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h3><strong>Instability Phase</strong><strong> </strong><br />
 <strong>(inharmonic)</strong></h3>
 <h4><strong>Instability by Excess</strong></h4>
 <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textRed">Tendency</span>): <span class="textRed">Confrontation, Win/Loose. Conquering Spirit.</span><br />
 Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Circumstancial Adjustment. Justification.</span><br />
 <br />
 When a person responding to symmetry order 5 enters an Instability Phase by <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
 <ul>
<li> This will enhance his <span class="textRed">animal</span>strokes; he may turn into someone only willing <span class="textRed">to win</span> at any cost, placing himself in a positin of permanent <span class="textRed">competition</span>, ein places where he can only <span class="textRed">win</span> or <span class="textRed">lose</span> under any circumstance.</li>
<li> Nevertheless, he manages <span class="textGreen">to adjust</span> thanks to his vegetal heart and also having a good enough nose to keep on varying circumstances of struggle and conquest. The intensity of his experiences make these <span class="textGreen">adjustments cicumstancial</span> and temporary and therefore of very little use, ending up in frustration and deception.</li>
<li>In the long run, his actions at this extent of excess, depend upon a sea of <span class="textRed">feelings</span> in which he <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> to whatever may come next, ending up in a barren and at times harmful chaos, for himself and to others around him, methodically <span class="textGreen">justifying</span> himself for his conduct.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h4><strong>Instability by Shortage</strong></h4>
 <ul>
<li> Relation to the world (<span class="textRed">Tendency</span>): <span class="textRed">Submission. Surrender. Hindrance.</span> </li>
<li> Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Fear and hesitation</span>. </li>
</ul>
 <p>Lack of harmony may also lead him to a <strong>Shortage</strong> condition:</p>
 <ul>
<li> His animal nature leaves him <span class="textRed">helpless</span>, fearing others and in a state of complete submission , where his born leader qualities have disappeared and are left buried, abandoning him to the mercy of others.</li>
<li> His <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> has turned to <span class="textGreen">fear</span>, in a <span class="textGreen">hesitating</span> condition, that leads him to <span class="textRed">surrender</span>, meaning that he will consciously and voluntarily hand over his affairs to others, those against which he would have fought or defied at another time.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When a person responding to symmetry order 5 suffers an instability phase by <strong>Shortage </strong>, this may manifest itself:</p>
 <p>Inner Nature/Restoration/Rescue:<br />
  <span class="textBlue">Resistance to the environment. Inclusion. Rejection. Constant and excessive control.</span></p>
 <p>In this way, some of these individuals appeal to their <span class="textBlue">mineral</span>, nature, which has remained latent until then:</p>
 <ul>
<li> when total shortage takes place, his <span class="textBlue">mineral</span>, nature will appear to the rescue, pushing him to <span class="textBlue">control</span> the external world and circumstances, in such an <span class="textBlue">excessive</span> way but wrongly directed and in vain.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Synopsis</strong> </h3>
 <p>This makes evident the instability of these determinations: </p>
 <ul>
<li> people responding to symmetry order 5, facing an extreme situation: at first they <span class="textRed">confront</span>, <span class="textRed">fight</span> appealing to all the <span class="textGreen">emotional variables</span> they possess or <span class="textRed">voluntarily submit</span>, they <span class="textRed">surrender</span>, by <span class="textGreen">fear</span> and <span class="textGreen">hesitation</span>. When the situation turns extreme they usually try to
<span class="textBlue">control</span> reality in a fruitless way.</li>
 </ul>
