	<h2><strong>Simmetry Dynamics</strong></h2>
	<p>The manifestation Phases of the different  simmetries, are under no doubt, dynamic, meaning not static.</p>
    <p>It all depends on the individual&acute;s  interaction with its environment, regarding the different circumstances and  their corresponding influence.</p>
    <p>So much so, both the 2 Phases and their 4  Determinations, may vary from one circumstance to another.</p>
    <p>At times one may be in harmony,&nbsp; then undergo an excess or a shortage, facing  different situations or eventualities.</p>
    <p>Then the Stability Phase might imply  harmony, where the individual ought to be at its peak, depending on their own  singularities and individual talents.</p>
    <p>When an individual gets stuck in any of the  Instability Phase Determinations, he will then start losing integral harmony.&nbsp; This lack of harmony will distort his  perception of reality, as if&nbsp; watching  through a prism, thus originating a totally different way of feeling and  interacting in the world.</p>

  <h4>
		People responding to symmetry order 1:</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>Are always active and are easily recognized because they never rest, that their <u>necessary condition</u> towards the world is <span class="textRed"><strong>movement</strong></span>.</li>
	</ul>
    <ul>
      <li>They are constantly working, surrounding themselves by newcomers who they dazzle with their knowledge, intelligence, their brand-new <span class="textBlue"><strong>projects</strong></span> and their wit.<br />
      They are tireless, are always seeking new goals and challenges to work with in every field, given that his main  <u>theme</u> is <span class="textRed"><strong>space</strong></span> and his <u>world desideratum in the world</u> is <span class="textRed"><strong>expansion</strong></span>.<br />
      Reluctant to follow others, more inclined to be the ones who guide the steps to follow.      </li>
      <li>Many people see them as role-models and they ususally transmit energy and inspire trust upon their subordinates or their family and their close circles, given their <u>tendency</u>:  <span class="textRed"><strong>coverage of the surroundings</strong></span>.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, their mineral heart will make them always seek for  <span class="textBlue"><strong>perfection</strong></span> and <span class="textBlue"><strong>stability</strong></span> (<u>necessary condition</u> and <u>individual desideratum</u>), they might turn out to be highly demanding with themselves and others, never giving up if they can prove themselves better with a new action. </li>
      <li>In harmony, the challenges they may actively pose to others, will be  in most cases successful as they will rely upon their own <strong>identity</strong><span class="textBlue"><strong></strong></span> traits (<u>Theme:</u> <span class="textBlue"><strong>consolidation</strong></span>) (<u>Experience</u>: <span class="textBlue"><strong>stability of their individuality</strong></span>)</li>
</ul>
    <p>Due to this articulation: <span class="textRed"><strong>animal towards the world </strong></span> and <span class="textBlue"><strong>mineral in the heart</strong></span><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>They will seek <span class="textRed">to be appreciated </span> for their <span class="textBlue">individuality</span> and <span class="textBlue">personality</span>, for those assets that make them unique and make them stand out from the rest. </li>
  <li>Guided by this urge, they will search for <span class="textRed">spaces</span> within a <span class="textBlue">structure</span>: meaning, they     will need that all the spaces they cover {social activities, family, affections have    to be perfectly ruled by a stable structure}  They will order their actions by an     inner classification thus  <span class="textRed">imprinting</span> reality with their <span class="textBlue">personal seal</span>.</li>
  <li>That is why all his  <span class="textRed">movements</span> will always aim at his personal  <span class="textBlue">consolidation</span>.</li>
  <li>That is also why they will always try  <span class="textRed">expansion</span> in the world  to reach  <span class="textBlue">perfection</span> as a primordial goal in their lives.</li>
  <li>Therefore this tendency of  <span class="textRed"></span>coverage of the surroundings implies the  <span class="textBlue">stability of    his identity </span> in projecting towards the world the Non Conscious Purpose of his <span class="textGreen"><strong>Vegetal Nature</strong></span>: manifestation of his <span class="textGreen">Sensitivity Transformation</span>.</li>
</ul>
	<h3>
		Instability Phase<br />
  (inharmonic)</h3>
  <h4>
    Instability by Excess</h4>
	<p>Relation to the world: <span class="textRed">Confrontation/Win/Loose/Conquest Spirit</span>.</p>
  <p>Relation to himself: <span class="textBlue">Permanent and Excessive Control.</span></p>
  <p>When a person responding to Symmetry Order 1 suffers an Instability Phase by  <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>his animal characteristics are reinforced and they may turn into  highly compettitive people (<span class="textRed"><strong>Confrontation/Win/Loose</strong></span>) searching for success at any cost (<span class="textRed"><strong>Conquest Spirit</strong></span>).</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, their mineral heart will lead them to always try and be in command of situations, imposing a <span class="textBlue"><strong>strong</strong></span> and<span class="textBlue"><strong> excessive control</strong></span>, almost opressive to themselves, to circumstances and to those around him.</li>
      <li>These intents will have poor results, in keeping under his wing, on a permanent basis,  whatever is going on, though he will try different options and possibilities to attain this, attempting to apply pressure and confronting with his control.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>
		Instability by Shortage</h4>
  <p>Relation to the world  (<span class="textRed"></span>Tendency): </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="textRed"> Submission/Capitulation/Hindrance.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Relation to himself  (<span class="textBlue">Experience</span>):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="textBlue">Anxiety by devastation</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a person responding to Symmetry Order 1 suffers an Instability Phase by<strong> Shortage</strong>:</p>
  <p>The Instability manifests itself by the apparition  of the animal-mineral nature of the individual in shortage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>feeling cornered and helpless, with no energy nor initiative  (<span class="textRed"><strong>hindrance</strong></span>). He  starts to develop a certain fear and therefore decides to adopt a complete state of <span class="textRed"><strong>submission</strong></span> towards others. Showing a complete  <span class="textRed"><strong>captulation</strong></span>.</li>
    <li>At his darkest hour, he will feel he&acute;s lost everything.  Internally, due to his mineral condition, a <span class="textBlue"><strong>state of anxiety</strong></span>, and <span class="textBlue"><strong>devastation</strong></span> will pervade and take hold of him completely, increasing the impossibility to regain leadership.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When a person responding to Symmetry Order 1 suffers an Instability Phase by <strong>Shortage, the following may manifest</strong>:</p>
  <p>Inner Nature/Restoration/Rescue: </p>
  <p class="textGreen"> Alteration of the environment/Circumstancial Adjustment/Justification </p>
  <p>Thus, some of these individuals appeal to their <span class="textGreen">vegetal</span>, nature, which had remained latent uptill now:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>facing an extreme situation, they adjust to new circumstances instead of trying to  change them and they keep on changing their needs and wishes according to  different difficulties that they may encounter, always inefficiently. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h3>
  <p>This makes evident the instability of these determinations: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>people responding to symmetry order 1, facing an extreme situation: at first, they will <span class="textRed">confront</span> and <span class="textBlue">control</span> to find a way to tackle the situation or they will submit and <span class="textRed">capitulate</span> in anxiety by devastation  and when the situation really gets extreme they usually <span class="textGreen">adjust circumstancially</span><span class="textGreen">, fruitlessly appealing to justification</span>.</li>
  </ul>
