	<h2><strong>Simmetry Dynamics</strong></h2>
    <p>The manifestation Phases of the different  simmetries, are under no doubt, dynamic, meaning not static.</p>
    <p>It all depends on the individual&acute;s  interaction with its environment, regarding the different circumstances and  their corresponding influence.</p>
    <p>So much so, both the 2 Phases and their 4  Determinations, may vary from one circumstance to another.</p>
    <p>At times one may be in harmony,&nbsp; then undergo an excess or a shortage, facing  different situations or eventualities.</p>
    <p>Then the Stability Phase might imply  harmony, where the individual ought to be at its peak, depending on their own  singularities and individual talents.</p>
    <p>When an individual gets stuck in any of the  Instability Phase Determinations, he will then start losing integral harmony.&nbsp; This lack of harmony will distort his  perception of reality, as if&nbsp; watching  through a prism, thus originating a totally different way of feeling and  interacting in the world.</p>

 <p>People responding to symmetry order 8:</p>
 <ul>
<li> may be recognized for their apparent discretion and simplicity, and their <span class="textBlue">stability</span> (<u>Necessary condition to the world</u>) and they are always working to guide their lives on works through which they will feel <span class="textBlue">integrated</span> (<u>World Desideratum</u>)to reality and might outlive them so as to leave a legacy of their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> (<u>Inner theme</u>). </li>
<li> They are not very talkative with strangers, not very showy, often submerged in their own thoughts and ideas. They integrate to the group they belong to, that makes the <span class="textBlue">structure</span> of his life almost <span class="textBlue">invariable</span> (<span class="textBlue"><u>Tendencia</u></span>).</li>
<li> AThey love it peace and quiet, in many cases almost absolutely. These people find in their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> (Inner theme) refuge from the world. They enjoy sitting quietly reading a book, watching films on T.V. or they may spend the whole morning pondering about new plans and ideas.</li>
<li> Though they seem to live in a lonely world, once they gain confidence, they reveal themselves as really loving and honouring their own work, eager to improve their skills and profession, often getting <span class="textGreen">perfectionist</span> and obsessive about details; having a great ability <span class="textGreen">to vary</span> (<u>Necessary inner condition</u>)the emotional guide-line of their purposes within their life-structure.</li>
<li> These people do not ususally dream with long trips or to stand out in some sport, they do wish to keep on nourishing their intellect or improving their art-skills, to accomplish astonishing works that will make them part of to the communities or groups they aspire to belong to, because deep in their hearts they long to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span> (<u>Individual Desideratum</u>). </li>
<li> They may be great art-followers, in any of its expressions and usually show a refined and exquisite taste in every sphere of their lives. They are often that kind of person, with the prompt and good advise, usually surprising with their unique and useful remarks, witnessing they have not lived their lives in vain, as an intent for <span class="textGreen">their own perpetuation</span> (<u>Experience</u>) through these actions. </li>
<li> They usually don´t talk about what they don´t know and finding themselves surrounded by people they don´t hold many points in common, they usually withdraw and may get lost in their own thoughts.  In fact, it is not unfrequent that they arise from this apparent absence, enticed by a new idea or the solution to a problem that had kept them worried.</li>
</ul>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
 Due to this articulation: <strong class="textBlue">mineral to the world</strong> and <span class="textGreen"><strong>vegetal heart</strong></span><strong>:</strong></p>
 <ul>
<li> They will wish <span class="textBlue">to be accepted</span> for their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span> for their <span class="textGreen">emotional abilities</span> that make them unique and stand out from the rest. </li>
<li> Within that desire they will look for <span class="textBlue">boundaries</span> in their <span class="textGreen">variability</span>: meaning they will need to clearly define which is the limit for every circumstance in (social, family, emotional activities). They will put in order their actions and creativity, as if needing to know the right perspective of  possibilities within reality.</li>
<li> That's why from this <span class="textBlue">stability</span> they will always try and express their inner <span class="textGreen">sensibility</span>.</li>
<li> That´s why they will look for <span class="textBlue">integration</span> in the world, to <span class="textGreen">manifest their sensitivity</span> as a primordial goal in their lives.</li>
<li> Therefore this tendency to move within the <span class="textBlue">structure invariability</span> implies the possibility of expressing their <span class="textGreen">sensitivity</span>& projecting to the world the Non conscious purpose of their <strong class="textRed">Animal Nature</strong>: manifesting the <span class="textRed">Versatility of expansion</span>. </li>
</ul>
 <h3 ><strong>Instability Phase </strong><br />
 <strong>&nbsp;(inharmonic)</strong></h3>
 <h4 ><strong>Instability by Excess</strong></h4>
 <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textBlue">Tendency</span>): <span class="textBlue">Resistance to the environment. Inclusion. Rejection</span>. <br />
 Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Circumstancial Adjustment. Justification</span></p>
 <p>When a person reponding to Symmetry order 8 suffers an Instability Phase by
 <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
 <ul>
<li> It will enhance some of the mineral traits in such a way, that in spite of numerous intents, they will never manage to fully <span class="textBlue">integrate</span> the environment nor to others, turning their rich interior universe into a disorganized chaos never managing to fullfil it in a complete work.  It´s the case of those writers who cannot mange to grasp their great potential into a story or a novel, in spite of all the ideas flourishing in their heads. Not being able to produce or to give shape in real life to their wishes, they will appeal to <span class="textGreen">justification</span> for their acts or will <span class="textGreen">adjust</span> depending on the circumstances.</li>
<li> In such a way, his response to the environment will always present a polarity: <span class="textBlue">rejection</span> or <span class="textBlue">forced adjustment</span>. Thus, his heart will determine an <span class="textGreen">adecuación</span> which will only last <span class="textGreen">circumstancially</span> and his relation to the environment will be experienced painfully. </li>
</ul>
 <h3 ><strong>Instability Phase </strong><br />
 <strong>&nbsp;(inharmonic)</strong></h3>
 <h4 ><strong>Instability by Shortage</strong></h4>
 <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textBlue">Tendency</span>): <span class="textBlue">Contraction</span> <br />
 Relation to himself (<span class="textGreen">Experience</span>): <span class="textGreen">Fear with hesitation</span>.</p>
 <p>When a person responding to symmetry order 8 suffers an Instability Phase
by <strong>Shortage</strong>: </p>
 <ul>
<li> life will find him enclosed within himself, totally <span class="textBlue">contracted</span> into his own boundaries and without self-confidence. They may turn into <span class="textGreen">hesitant</span>, persons, who seem to have lost their inspiration and the north that guided their lives. In meetings, they seem absent but not because their thoughts are elsewhere but because they have been caught by melancholy for no apparent reason. A deep <span class="textGreen">hesitation</span> has appeared, leaving them helpless.</li>
</ul>
 <p>When a person who responds to symmetry 8 suffers an Instability Phase by <strong>Shortage </strong> the following manifests itself:</p>
 <ul>
<li> Inner Nature/restoration/rescue:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
 <p><span class="textRed">Confrontation. Win/Loose. Conquest spirit. Constant change of strategies.</span><br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
 So, some of these individuals  appeal to their animal nature which has remained
dormant until then:</p>
 <ul>
<li> These people under a shortage situation usually try to alter the situations that produced them, eventhough they may not evaluate the consequences that this might bring.</li>
<li> That is why they usually react almost instinctively, without giving it a second thought in a purely reflex move by means of which they only wish to survive, revealing a change in their own personal traits that will permanently <span class="textRed">confront</span> them to the world in an unhappy, inefficient way. </li>
</ul>
 <h3 ><strong>Synopsis</strong></h3>
 <p>This gives shape to the instability of these determinations: </p>
 <ul>
<li> people responding to symmetry 8 facing an extreme situation: at first <span class="textBlue">resist inclusion</span> or <span class="textBlue">reject it</span>, appealin to any sort of <span class="textGreen">circumstancial adjustment, justifying himself</span> or will voluntarily <span class="textBlue">ccontact within himself</span> facing the new circumstance they will find themselves in a condition where <span class="textGreen">fear</span> and <span class="textGreen">hesitation</span> prevails. When the situation gets really extreme they usually try and <span class="textRed">confront reality</span> trying to <span class="textRed">conquer it</span> appealing to <span class="textRed">constant change of strategies</span> in a fruitless way.</li>
</ul>
