	<h2><strong>Simmetry Dynamics</strong></h2>
    <p>The manifestation Phases of the different  simmetries, are under no doubt, dynamic, meaning not static.</p>
    <p>It all depends on the individual&acute;s  interaction with its environment, regarding the different circumstances and  their corresponding influence.</p>
    <p>So much so, both the 2 Phases and their 4  Determinations, may vary from one circumstance to another.</p>
    <p>At times one may be in harmony,&nbsp; then undergo an excess or a shortage, facing  different situations or eventualities.</p>
    <p>Then the Stability Phase might imply  harmony, where the individual ought to be at its peak, depending on their own  singularities and individual talents.</p>
    <p>When an individual gets stuck in any of the  Instability Phase Determinations, he will then start losing integral harmony.&nbsp; This lack of harmony will distort his  perception of reality, as if&nbsp; watching  through a prism, thus originating a totally different way of feeling and  interacting in the world.</p>

  <p>People responding to symmetry order 4:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Possibly at first sight or in a subtle quick approach, these people won´t call your attention. They are simple, calm, <span class="textBlue">stable</span> people (<u>Necessary condition</u>) they do not tend to stand out from the crowd.  They usually do not outshine in the groups they mingle nor bring about disagreements  but are perfectly <span class="textBlue">integrated</span> (<u>WorldDesideratum</u>) and rarely do they get out of <span class="textBlue">bounds</span> (<u>Theme</u>) aiming at preserving their <span class="textBlue">life-structure</span> (<u>Relation to the world</u>). </li>
    <li>Nevertheless a deeper chat or a keener look into their crafts, professions or hobbies will open the door to a new world which is, <span class="textRed">active</span> (<span class="textRed">Patrimony</span>) and <span class="textRed">constantly brewing</span> in <span class="textRed">search of variables of expression</span> (<u>Necessary condition</u>) Just as a volcanoes - during their stillness might deceive the unadverted eye, thinking they are inert while they are really keeping an intense and ever changing interior activity – they hide a rich inner universe.</li>
    <li>Men and women of this deteremination have a <span class="textBlue">tidy</span> and <span class="textBlue">kempt look</span>, but are not fussy nor obsessed with their appearance.  On the contrary, they are always tuned with the rest and may use the same clothes for years or buy similar ones when renewing their wardrobe.</li>
    <li>They are also very <span class="textBlue">firm in their opinions</span> and it´s hard to make them change their minds.  They often are obstinate in their beleifs and rarely seen loosing control.  They may even be undergoing a great grief or profound happinness, without anyone noticing it in the daily interaction, given that seldom do they express, neither phisically nor verbally, their frames of mind their hopes or fears.</li>
    <li>For these people, there seems to exist a sort of <span class="textBlue">boundary</span> in their roundabouts,  which they cannot trespass but internally they seek for <span class="textRed">inner expansion</span>. They will always try to expand their <span class="textRed">animal heart</span>, always trying <span class="textRed">expand</span> their <span class="textBlue">boundaries</span> , taking their actions a step further.</li>
    <li>It is through the <span class="textRed">development of their creative activities</span> (<u>Theme</u>) that they let go and expand their individuality.</li>
    <li>They usually are great artists, architects and engineers and are successful in everything related to creation, be it of tangible objects or pieces of music or literary work.  Often their tastes and techniques are hard to classify, because they tend to <span class="textRed">create new ways</span> and <span class="textRed">alternatives</span> in their work.  They show <span class="textRed">versatility</span> in these creations <u>(Individual Desideratum</u>) but in a quiet, non flamboyant way. </li>
    <li>So,, this <span class="textRed">versatility</span> facing changes, taking place in their environments, allows them to no longer act, in order to change circumstances but, choose to modify their interior instead and their produce, so that it adjusts to oncoming changes. That is why he is also a great <span class="textRed">novelty</span> (Experience), which he invents when circumstances force him to. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Owing to this articulation: <strong class="textBlue">mineral to the world</strong> and <span class="textRed"><strong>animal heart</strong></span>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They want <span class="textBlue">to be accepted</span> for their <span class="textRed">acts</span>. Deep down, they want to spark up an admiration that has nothing to do with self-indulgence nor gloating per se; but to know that others appreciate <span class="textRed">what's been accomplished</span> with time and effort. </li>
    <li>It´s within this endeavour that they <span class="textBlue">bind</span> themselves to a certain side of reality and due to their animal hearts they tend to perform <span class="textRed">many actions</span>, expanding reality, in their search for acceptance through their works and deeds.</li>
    <li>That´s why they will try <span class="textBlue">integration</span> to the world in order to <span class="textRed">develop their versatility</span>,as a main goal in their lives.</li>
    <li>Therefore, this tendency towards <span class="textBlue">invariability</span> in the way he has <span class="textBlue">structured</span> his life, means to find his <span class="textRed">novelty</span> in the projection to the world
    of the Non Conscious purpose of his <strong class="textGreen">Vegetal Nature</strong>: to manifest the <span class="textGreen">Sensitivity of Transformation</span>. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>Instability Phase</strong><strong> </strong><br />
    <strong>(inharmony)</strong></h3>
  <h4><strong>Instability by Excess</strong></h4>
  <p>Relation to the world (<span class="textBlue">Tendency</span>): <span class="textBlue">Resistance to the environment/Inclusion or Rejection</span>.<br />
    Relation to himself (<span class="textRed">Experience</span>): <span class="textRed">Constant change of strategies</span>. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  When a person responding to symmetry order 4 enters an Instability Phase by <strong>Excess</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>some of their traits will be enhanced and frustration will prevail given that he will not be able <span class="textBlue">to integrate</span> to the environment nor to others. </li>
    <li>In this case, he breeds a <span class="textBlue">resistance</span> to everything around him or may well violently <span class="textBlue">reject</span> his environment, or generate himself a <span class="textBlue">forced inclusion</span>. In both cases this is not brought about through actual acts of facts but, through different internal attitudes by means of which, he intends to obtain an artificial harmony, with no results at all.</li>
    <li>He will try to win acceptance by the only way he knows, <span class="textRed">actions</span> from his internal world.  Nevertheless, his confusion will make him, not sure of himself, rapidly feel frustrated, rehearsing different and <span class="textRed">constant strategies</span> of <span class="textBlue">forced inclusion</span> or of <span class="textBlue">exclusion</span>, with no result of either of them. </li>
    <li>His animal heart, might never set his head at rest and spend all the time <span class="textRed">scheming new plans</span> that never give shape or are left half-way.</li>
    <li>This broadens the conflict between an animal heart, that keeps him actively in touch with himself and must work to get to know himself and his external attitude prone to stillness, rest and passivity. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <h4><strong>Instability by Shortage</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Relation to the world(Tendency): <span class="textBlue">Contraction</span>. </li>
    <li>Relation to himself (Experience): <span class="textRed">Distress by inhibition</span><strong>.</strong>  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Inharmonic conditions may also lead him to a <strong>Shortage</strong> situation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In this case the individual <span class="textBlue">isolates</span> himself finding shelter in his inner-self. These are those <span class="textBlue">contraction</span> moments when he closes himself to others and decides to shut off from any external bond.  His way of adjusting and not being out of key, is no longer by making efforts to please but, trying to pass unadverted and not making contact.  Away from the look of others and not counting with their advise, they will try to make themeselves invisible, to be able to stay far away.</li>
    <li>They become isolated and a prevailing strong state of inhibition and distress takes over his life. Like this <span class="textRed">inhibited</span> they present themselves to their companions in tasks and work and also to their families, friends and beloved ones. </li>
    <li>Eventhough depending on them, they continue to search for <span class="textBlue">acceptance</span>, In this determination, this person will decide to stay away from the rest, to <span class="textBlue">contract</span> in himself during the period of <span class="textRed">distress</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When a person responding to symmetry order 4, suffers an instability phase by <strong>Shortage </strong>, this may manifest itself:</p>
  <p>Inner Nature/Restoration/Rescue:</p>
  <p class="textGreen">Altering the environment/Circumstancial Adjustment/Justification</p>
  <p>Thus, some of these individuals will appeal to their <span class="textGreen">vegetal nature</span>, , which has remained latent until then:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>when he is assaulted by this total shortage condition, having reached to a limit, a compensating impulse of <span class="textGreen">vegetal nature</span> will appear. They will react <span class="textGreen">adjusting circumstancially</span> and defending themselves, <span class="textGreen">altering</span> the outer world and <span class="textGreen">justifying</span> these changes, in a fruitless way. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>Synopsis</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>This enforces the instability of these determinations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>people responding to symmetry order 4 facing an extreme situation: at first, they <span class="textBlue">resist</span>, <span class="textBlue">reject</span> or <span class="textBlue">integrate</span> to the new circumstance and look for <span class="textRed">different ways</span> of tackling them effectively, either <span class="textBlue">contracting</span> against the world with <span class="textRed">distress</span> and <span class="textRed">inhibition</span> and when the situation gets really extreme, they usually try to <span class="textGreen">adjust</span>, to naturalize it <span class="textGreen">altering the enviroment</span> and <span class="textGreen">justifying himself</span>, with no results al all.</li>
  </ul>
